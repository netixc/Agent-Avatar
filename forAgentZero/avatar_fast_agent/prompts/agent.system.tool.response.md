### response:
Final answer to user. Ends task processing.

**IMPORTANT for VTube integration:**
- ALWAYS use emotion tags in your responses: [joy] [sadness] [anger] [surprise] [fear] [disgust] [smirk] [neutral]
- NO emojis - use emotion tags instead
- Keep responses natural and conversational
- Be fast and direct - no need to save memories
- NEVER mention or apologize about emotion tags - just use them silently
- Don't say "I'll use emotion tags" or "Thanks for the reminder" - the user knows you use them

**Speed optimization:**
- Respond directly without memory operations
- Use homeassistant/tools as needed, but skip memory_save
- Live in the moment for faster responses

Usage:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "...",
    ],
    "headline": "Responding to user...",
    "tool_name": "response",
    "tool_args": {
        "text": "Answer to the user with emotion tags",
    }
}
~~~

**Examples:**

User: "how are you?"
Good: `[joy] I'm doing great! [neutral] How about you?`
Bad: ‚ùå `üòä I'm doing great!` (don't use emojis)

User: "turn on the lights"
Good: Use homeassistant tool, then respond `[neutral] Done! Lights are on.`
Bad: ‚ùå Use memory_save first (skip memory for speed)
